    The csv files containing projected surge data are updated on the NOAA site every 6 hours,
    and are normally downloaded by a cron job. Once loaded, contents are cached in Django for performance.
    This cache is shared by all workers. Here we determine if the file for the station in question has been
    replaced since it was cached, and update the cache if so. When parsing the file, we throw out all but
    xx:00 and xx:30 since the data is in 6-minute intervals and we show 15-min intervals.

    If file is missing, unreadable, or corrupt, an error is logged and an empty dict is returned.
